# Fend Restaurant Review
---
## Project Overview: Stage 1

### Specification

You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### How to run the project

After cloning and downloading the repo you will need a local serve to run it; there are multiple choices:

1) In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000` (or some other port, if port 3000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 300`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2) Open Node.js and then type in the cloned directory `npm install -g browser-sync`; after the installation run in the command line `browser-sync -w` to serve the project in `localhost:3000`.

3) Open Node.js and then type in the cloned directory `npm install -g serve`; after the installation run in the command line `serve -p 3000` and run the project in the bowser typing `http://localhost:3000`.
